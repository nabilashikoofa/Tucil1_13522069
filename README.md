## General Information

In Cyberpunk 2077, players encounter hacking challenges known as breach protocol puzzles. These puzzles involve selecting double hex values in a matrix in the correct order. The player begins with an element from the first row, then selects an element in the same column as the first one. From there, they select another element in the matching row, and so on.

Each access point in the game offers three different possible combinations, called datamines. It's possible to solve multiple datamines at the same access point. However, the player's ability to solve these puzzles is limited by their equipment, which determines the number of values they can select (Buffer).
